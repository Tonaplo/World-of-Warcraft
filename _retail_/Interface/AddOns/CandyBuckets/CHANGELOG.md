- - Fixed bug where some maps didn't contain themselves and icons would disappear.  
    - Added a simple list modifier that will make a list of nodes appear in the middle of the map, it's quick and dirty way to dump anything we should have shown on map but as a list for easier hunting. Hold down any modifier when navigating the map or opening it to display this list.
