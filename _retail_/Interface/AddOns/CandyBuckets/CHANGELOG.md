# CandyBuckets

## [v8.2.5.191026](https://github.com/Vladinator89/wow-addon-candybuckets/tree/v8.2.5.191026) (2019-10-26)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Vladinator89/wow-addon-candybuckets/compare/v8.2.5.191021...v8.2.5.191026)

- Fixed faction for the newest BfA buckets. They are not both neutral anymore.  
    Adjusted the Westfall bucket due to phasing, it has two locations but you can only get one, as expected. Because the phase isn't known, yet, I show a indicator where you should go and check, and they both go away after quest is completed.  
    Added several missing zones like Crystalsong Forest, Vale of Eternal Blossoms, Zuldazar, Dazar'alor, Tiragarde Sound, to show their underlying cities and locations on their parent zone maps.  
    Adding the world view so when you zoom out to look at Azeroth, you will see the locations in all the sub-continents, more or less. Let me know if it's a game breaker, but it seems to be working quite nicely as a completionist view.  
- Just to be super safe, ignore the travis file by name.  
- TOC bump and WoWInterface automatic packaging.
