    Initial Shadowlands Support
    
    * Covenant and Soulbinds are exported if available
    * Great Vault rewards are included as gear comments
    * Frame is now resizable and location is persistent across logins
    * UI Frames are now handled in code rather than XML
    
    This version is compatible with both 8.3 and 9.0 so will work on retail,
    PTR, and beta. Addon will also have version bumps as retail is updated
    to avoid out-of-date addon warnings.
    
    Addon version numbering will now follow the WoW client version more
    closely as well.
