[Full Changelog](https://github.com/funkydude/SexyMap/compare/v8.0.4...v8.0.5)

- Buttons: Correctly parent the zone text.  
- Buttons: Fix not being able to hide the dungeon status indicators.  
- ZoneText: Fix zone text not hiding.  
- Coordinates: Make sure the text doesn't expand beyond the border.  
- Buttons: Tweak the button fading code.  
- Use LibDBIcon as a feed for new addon buttons. This completely drops support for custom made addon buttons. SexyMap will no longer maintain an arbitrary list of these. Ask authors to use LibDBIcon to build their minimap icons.
