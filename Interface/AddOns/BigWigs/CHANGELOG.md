# BigWigs

## [v42.1](https://github.com/BigWigsMods/BigWigs/tree/v42.1) (2017-02-04) [](#top)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BigWigsMods/BigWigs/compare/v42...v42.1)

- Nighthold/Etraeus: Experiment with nameplate callbacks. The idea behind this is that we fire callbacks to tell nameplate addons when and where to show friendly nameplates, and what debuffs should be shown on them. This lets the nameplate addon handle customization instead of trying to handle it ourselves. The end result is we don't turn nameplate addons into boss mods, and we don't turn bigwigs into a nameplate addon.  
- Elisande - Add P1 Ablation Tank Warning (#157)  
- Update zhTW (#158)  
- Krosus: Fix missing Fel Beam timers after receiving sync
