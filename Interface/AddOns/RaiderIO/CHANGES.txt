    [Raider.IO] Database Refresh

    - Improve the deprecated message to emphasise on the addon we suspect causes the error, not so much on the API itself, as it can seem misleading when the RaiderIO is outlined in bold letters. I just hope other authors don't hate us if we accidentally blame their addon, like WeakAura might missfire if custom coded plugins started to call and get blamed on the main addon. Sorry!
