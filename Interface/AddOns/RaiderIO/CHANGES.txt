    [Raider.IO] Database Refresh

commit c96b4f4be28576d850023fe901c5f2b8e72e3107

    - Added back the information about having to reload the UI if client enhancements are enabled or disabled. This is accounted for during loading, so we can't turn it on or off on demand.
    
    - Respecting your choice to not show the guild best in your mythic tab if turned off.
    - If the RaiderIO Client isn't used we will attempt to get a list of the guilds best runs for the week with the old API that still exists. It's a fallback in order to show something instead of nothing for those not using the client program.
