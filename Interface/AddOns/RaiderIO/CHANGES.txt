    - The debug module is experimental and had to add a warning about use, until I figure a neat and clean way to implement autocompletion myself without much hassle. For now this will serve alright for early alpha testing purposes.

    - Added a debug dialog to help quickly lookup a player realm and name. This tool is still restricted on what data is loaded, so running this with the US database, won't let you query EU characters. It's still a great and simple way to check if your realm is visible and loaded, and if your character is in the addon or not. You can access the dialog using the command: /raiderio debug
