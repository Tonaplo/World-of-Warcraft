    Develop (#18)
    
    - Reorganizing the core, trying to make it a bit easier to read, and finally transformed our dungeon references instead of index (1..14) to use a enum table.
    - Converted key level to base score to use numbers instead of strings.
    - Removed the UI reload question when toggling dropdown options, after the changes this isn't needed anymore.
    - BNet returns the level of the character. We Attempt to filter away low levels from even trying to show score or the Copy URL options. Some areas might not be that easy to filter on this, but most used areas do follow the max level rule.
    - Added a bunch of dropdowns to monitor, we need to comment away some if they aren't usefull.
    - Added basic skin support for Aurora, but can add more. Hopefully frameworks like elvUI have API to skin a dropdown template, since thats what we inherit anyway.
    - Fixed a issue with LFG tooltips and dropdowns, so we properly monitor the dropdown option when showing our dropdown Copy URL button.
    - Adjusted dropdown menu to not fade away when we move the mouse over our own dropdown menu below. Will have to keep an eye on this in case it introduces taint.
    - Tweaked base copy URL frame offset, added Copy URL behavior to SELF frame, shortened "Copy Raider.IO Profile URL" text
